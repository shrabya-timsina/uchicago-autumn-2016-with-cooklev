Comments: >
    Naming of variables can be improved, sometimes you
    made additions to the program (notably in case-checking with 
    assertions) which were well-intentioned but did not add much 
    utility to the function(s) in the way they were implemented.

    Your in-line comments are excessive.  Let your code speak
    for itself.
